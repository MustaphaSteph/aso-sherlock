# Sherlock - The ASO inspector

Sherlock is a program I wrote as a companion to my presentation at the [ASO Conference in NYC](https://asoconference.com/newyork/) in 2019.

It's based on top of a library I wrote called [pm-prophet](https://github.com/luke14free/pm-prophet)

It can produce curated reports about your app and it's traffic, including:
* Updates impact (both visual and textual updates)
* Seasonality
* Uplift

### Installation

1) [Install python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2) [Install pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/install/)
3) Open your terminal and run `pipenv install` from the folder in which you have cloned this repository

Et Voil√†. You should be all set.

### Preparing your data

Sherlock takes in input a csv file of different time-series. The naming convention is strict and it's case-sensitive.

**Required columns:**
1) `date` the date of the events (expressed in *dd/mm/yyyy* format, e.g. 12/30/2019).
2) `search_downloads` downloads data coming from iTunes connect filtered by App Store Search source
3) `search_impressions` impressions data coming from iTunes connect filtered by App Store Search source

**Optional columns (if you do Apple Search Ads):**
4) `asa_impressions` impressions coming from Apple Search Ads
5) `asa` downloads coming from Apple Search Ads

**Extra columns:** Any other time series you like (e.g. Facebook, Google, Snapchat..) for which to compute uplift.

### Usage

Usage is very simple, from the terminal run:

`python sherlock.py example.csv`

Where `example.csv` is the file created as in the point above.

If you wish to exclude Apple Search Ads uplift from the model (suggested if you want better seasonality fits), run:

`python sherlock.py example.csv --no-asa`

### Output

Open the `report.html` file generated by Sherlock.
